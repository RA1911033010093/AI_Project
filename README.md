# Earthquake Prediction Model

Objective: To predict when the earthquake will take place. Specifically to predict the time remaining before artificial earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data performed in laboratories.

Purpose of Problem Statement: As the purpose of short-term prediction is to enable emergency measures to reduce death and destruction.

Impact of this project: Potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure.
